# Workshop 2

The second workshop of CS326, which covers how to use Git in a group setting.

My friend once saw the famous David Mix Barrington walking the equally famous Cardie and Duncan, I was quite taken aback.

The third season of Haikyuu is coming out in October, I hope this does not affect my drive to learn.
